    - Check if current time is no-fly period
  - **Encounter Prevention** (Student separation)
    - Create/Get/Delete encounter groups
    - Check for conflicts before pass approval
  - **Location Capacity Management**
    - Set max capacity per location
    - Get current occupancy count
    - Check if location is full
    - Get capacity status for all locations
- Status: **Registered in server, ready to use**

**3. Security Hardening** ✅
- Files: 
  - `/app/backend/middleware/rate_limiter.py`
  - `/app/backend/middleware/security.py`

    - Tracks attempts per email
    - Auto-unlocks after duration
  - **Password Strength Validation**:
    - Min 8 characters
    - Requires: uppercase, lowercase, digit, special char
